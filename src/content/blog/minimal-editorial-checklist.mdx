Before publishing, I run this five-item pass:

1. Lead paragraph states the point in plain language.
2. Subheadings break long sections every 3-5 paragraphs.
3. Sentences are rewritten if they exceed one breath.
4. Code and media blocks have captions or context.
5. Links explain destination value before the click.

That keeps the writing clear without over-editing the draft.
