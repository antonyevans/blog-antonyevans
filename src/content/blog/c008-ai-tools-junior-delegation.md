How are you supposed to learn AI when you barely have time to do your job?

New tools launch daily. Everyone says you need to learn this stuff or get left behind.

But you're already stretched thin. "Learn on nights and weekends" isn't a strategy.

I took the extreme route: I left my job to learn this stuff full-time.

But there's a better path for most people.

You don't need to master every AI tool yourself. You need to decide which ones your team should use. Different skill.

So hire someone whose full-time job is to keep up for you.

A recent college grad. Curious, technically minded, eager to learn.

A friend of mine hired one in India for $5k a year.

They test every tool and idea you throw at them. They report back on what works and what's worth adding to your team's workflow.

Spend 30 minutes with them every morning assigning what to explore. Another 30 every evening hearing what they found.

You stay current. They get a front-row seat to how you think about technology.

That constant anxiety about falling behind? Gone.

What would you have them test first?
