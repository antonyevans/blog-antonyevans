      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Most DTC commentary is tactical. Most AI commentary is generic. I&#39;m interested in what happens at the intersection.</p>
      <p>I spent 7 years as COO scaling a DTC consumer brand &mdash; $50M revenue, $42M raised, led the company through Chapter 11 to profitability. Before that: YC, Bain, INSEAD, and a decade founding things (including an AI doctor app with 500k downloads). Now I&#39;m building AI systems and watching everything I learned about commerce change at the infrastructure level.</p>
      <p>Agentic AI is doing more to DTC than automating workflows. It&#39;s changing who the customer is, how acquisition works, what brand loyalty means, and which business models survive. Most operators aren&#39;t ready for it. Most AI builders don&#39;t understand the commerce layer. I sit in the gap between them.</p>
      <p>Right now: building AI systems and figuring out what to build next in this space. Writing about the shifts most DTC operators are still catching up to.</p>
      <p>If you&#39;re a DTC founder or operator trying to understand what agentic AI actually means for your business &mdash; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonyevans/">I&#39;d like to connect</a>.</p>
